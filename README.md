# Sydney-Data-Insights
A group project done during the summer analysing Sydney opal card and population dynamics data. Members include Siddharth Moharir, Jerome Uriah Ng, Th√†nh Trung and Destan Ozkan. All work was distributed equally, giving everyone the opportunitiy to learn different skills as the project progressed.

## Data Science Analysis of transport in Sydney

We are trying to analyse the preferred choice of transport (bus, rail, light rail and ferry) 

for different passengers depending on their demographics and regions in Sydney.

The results will help identify the regions which have the highest and the lowest use of transport. 
We can then identify the higher need to improve and maintain the transport in that region.

The transport data was collected from Transport NSW

Population Dataset comes from

# Summary 
It is obvious to admit that the Opal Card is an inseparable thing in every Sydneysiders' pocket. 
Developed and managed by the New South Wales Government's transport authority, 
Opal is a contactless public transport fee collection system in the greater Sydney area of New South Wales, Australia. 
First launched in late 2012, Opal made it more convenient and time-saving for the citizens to pay for their public transportation which include New South Wales' bus, rail, light rail and ferry services. 
In this project, we will analyze to see if there is any relationship between card user's average income, average age and the usage of different transport model. 
Further analytics processes would show that the number of tap-on events at a stop or train station or the volume of use of public transport is predictable or not.

# Aim 
To analyse the preferred choice of transport for different types of passengers depending on their demographics and region.
